`MidiBard 2` is an FF14 Bard plugin based on the Dalamud framework, which supports bard performance by MIDI files or keyboards. It was originally authored by [akira0245](https://github.com/akira0245/MidiBard), now developed by [Ori](https://github.com/reckhou/MidiBard) and other developers after he quit for real-life reasons.


# Why MidiBard 2?

* No need to set key bindings and hotbars on your every bards. 
* Minimal delay on playing notes, never drop any notes in crowded areas. Suits especially well for fast and busy songs.
* Based on in-game detection of bard ensemble mode, almost perfect sync between bards. Also supports manual sync if you wish to add a little bit of flavour to your song.
*  Automatically switches instruments by track names following BMP rules, all songs from [BMP MIDI repository](https://bmp.trotlinebeercan.com/) are supported.
* Switches songs and instruments across all bards in the same party, by commands. Those bards don't have to be on the same PC, which means it's possible to play with your friends, and they start to play automatically by following the ensemble mode, no need to countdown on Discord anymore!
* Plays any number of track on the MIDI file, separately transpose any track, or override the electric guitar's tone, which greatly helps for testing.
*  Therefore, if the switching tone is needed, it's much easier for composers to put "Clean" and "Overdriven" guitar on different tracks, and play those tracks only by one bard. No need to follow the low-efficient way of creating events by editing MIDI files anymore!
* Supports almost all MIDI keyboards.
* Auto-adapt notes outside of C3-C6 to help test unadapted songs.
* Track visualization, helps for testing/debugging.


# How to Install
To use you need to install and boot the game by using [FFXIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

This tutorial assumes you installed FFXIVLauncher and boot the game by it, and you have the basic knowledge of the usage of the Dalamud plugin system.

You need to add my custom plugin repository to install MidiBard.  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reckhou/DalamudPlugins-Ori/api6/pluginmaster.json` 

Please open ``Dalamud Settings``, on ``Experimental`` page, add a ``Custom Plugin Repository`` as below:

# How to Use
* **Where to Start?**  

Type `/midibard` in the chatbox and the window will show up. Press the `+` icon to add MIDI files to the playlist(hold `Ctrl` or `Shift` key to choose multiple files).  Double click any songs on the playlist to switch. Select the tracks you wish to play, and choose the instrument you wish to use.

Press the triangle icon to start playing.

If you are a solo bard, this is all you need to know ðŸ˜Š

* **How to Play as a Band**  

1. Form a party with all of your bards. For the first time user, I recommend trying it on 2 bards to help you get the idea of how it works, the rest are just adding more bards. Also the bards **DON'T** have to be on the same PC, which means it's possible to play with your friends at the same party.
2. After forming the party, import the MIDI files then immediately type `reloadplaylist` on **PARTY CHAT**. All bards on the **SAME PC** will then share the same playlist. You only need to do this once after changing the playlist. If you play with your friends, make sure everyone has the same playlist before continuing.
3. Type `switchto <song number>` in the party chat, then every bard in the party will load the same song and switch instruments if the track name follows BMP standards. For example, typing "switchto 1" will make everyone in the party open the 1st song on the playlist.
4. Check every bard to make sure everyone's choosing the correct track they are playing. You only need to do it once after rebooting the game or reloading the playlist. They will always play the same track number even on different songs.
5. After everything's been set, start the ensemble mode in-game and the song will start playing automatically.

# Q&A

* **How to Automatically Switch Guitar Tones?**

The easiest way is to separate tones on different tracks. For instance, you may have one track for clean guitar and another track for overdriven guitar. Your bard should choose both tracks and check if tones are being set correctly. When playing the song MidiBard switches the guitar tone automatically, and there's no need to edit the exported MIDI file to add tone-switching events.

* **Why My Song Sounds "Slower" at Some Parts?**

It's often caused by too many notes being played in a very short period, and it may exceed the game's limitation already. Other software might drop these notes, but MidiBard is designed not to drop any notes. So you may imagine that excessive amount of notes being put in a queue and they are being played later than they should be. You might want to check if your song is too busy, especially for chords and remove some notes if it's possible.

* **Why My Performance Sounds Lagging?**  
Please follow those settings shown below:

If your monitor has a higher refresh rate than 60Hz, Please limit it to 60 so the client doesn't take an excessive amount of resources.

We have tested to run the game under 15 FPS, and MidiBard still sounds okay and never drops notes under lower framerates. However, it's not recommended and you should always aim for 60 FPS for a better experience.

*There are also certain ways to disable the rendering of the game to make it run more smoothly, however, it's not what MidiBard is trying to do and we will not support any requests suggesting we do so.*

# Party Chat Command References

Type these commands in the party chat to control all bards in the same party that has MidiBard installed.

* **switchto [song number]**

Switching to the Xth song on the playlist. e.g. `switchto 2` will make every bard switch to the 2nd song on the playlist(assuming everyone has the same playlist).
* **close**

Stop playing and quit performance mode.

*  **reloadplaylist**

Reload the config file which saves the playlist. This can be used after any changes to the playlist so the clients on the same PC can have the same playlist.

# BMP Track Name References For Auto-Switch Instruments

Below are all instruments supported in the game. The track name of the MIDI file must follow those names, and MidiBard will switch in-game instruments by those names if the track is selected.

>Piano
>Harp
>Fiddle
>Lute
>Fife
>Flute
>Oboe
>Panpipes
>Clarinet
>Trumpet
>Saxophone
>Trombone
>Horn
>Tuba
>Violin
>Viola
>Cello
>Double Bass
>Timpani
>ElectricGuitarClean 
>ElectricGuitarMuted 
>ElectricGuitarOverdriven
>ElectricGuitarPowerChords 
>ElectricGuitarSpecial

`Program:ElectricGuitar` is not supported, since there are much easier and more direct ways to implement tone switch, by separating different tones to different tracks. Midibard switches tones automatically.

For transposition, add `+X` or `-X` after the instrument name. For instance, `Trombone+1` means +1 octave on the trombone track. This is especially helpful in composing software like `MuseScore`, so you can have the correct range when editing.

**Octave Ranges**

>Piano-1: C4-C7 
>Harp: C3-C6 
>Fiddle+1: C2-C5 
>Lute+1: C2-C5
>Fife-2 C5-C8 
>Flute-1: C4-C7 
>Oboe-1: C4-C7 
>Panpipes-1: C4-C7 
>Clarinet: C3-C6
>Trumpet: C3-C6 
>Saxophone: C3-C6
>Trombone+1: C2-C5
>Horn+1: C2-C5
>Tuba+1: C1-C4
>Violin: C3-C6
>Viola: C3-C6
>Cello+1: C2-C5
>Double Bass+2: C1-C4
>Timpani+1: C2-C5
>All Guitars+1: C2-C5
